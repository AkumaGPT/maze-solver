# Maze Solver

This is a simple Python maze solver using **BFS** and **DFS** algorithms.

## Files Included

- `maze_solver.py` — Python script for solving the maze
- `complex_maze.txt` — Text version of the maze input
- `bfs_path.png` — Visual representation of the BFS maze and solution
- `dfs_path.png` — Visual representation of the DFS maze and solution

## Features

- Solves maze using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- Visualizes the result using **Pillow (PIL)**
- Swaps path and wall colors and overlays solution in **red**

## How to Run

1. Install Pillow: pip install pillow

2. Run: python maze_solver.py
